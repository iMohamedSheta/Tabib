# What is a Service?

A internal service is a class responsible for handling internal operations or remote procedure calls (RPCs) within the application.
It does not directly interact with external APIs or user-facing actions, but rather focuses on performing specific business logic,
setting up necessary configurations, or executing tasks that are crucial for the application's flow.

## Key Characteristics:
- **Internal Operations**: Services perform internal processes that may not require user interaction but are essential for the system's functionality.
- **No Direct User Interaction**: Services typically don't expose an endpoint or API; instead, they operate within the application's internal logic.
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)**: A service may act like an internal RPC, calling various methods or orchestrating actions without needing external input.

## Example of Service:
- [OrganizationSetupService]:
--  This service is responsible for setting up the organization profile after the organization is created.
--   It handles the initialization of starter data (e.g., default clinic services) and other configuration steps.
--   It does not trigger any external API requests or responses but performs actions within the application after the organization is created.

## Summary:
Services in this application are designed to handle business logic, internal setup,
and other background tasks that don't directly involve API interactions but are essential to the application's processes.
